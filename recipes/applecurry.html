    <h2>Why Apple Curry Turkey Pita</h2>
    <p>
        This is great for turkey leftovers. Simple, quick and flavorful. This is a good one for substitutions too. I've used white wine in place of lemon, sour cream in place of yogurt, chicken in place of turkey and Indian naan in place of the pita. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>

        <li>½ pound cooked turkey, cut into chunk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 medium apple, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 pita bread rounds</li>
        <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
